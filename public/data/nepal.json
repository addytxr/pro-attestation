Nepal is not a member of the Hague Apostille Convention, which means Indian documents must be attested by the Embassy of Nepal in India to be legally accepted there.\nWhether you're applying for a job in Nepal, a student visa, or need to register a company or property, the Nepal embassy attestation process ensures your documents are verified and legally valid for use in Nepal. We offer comprehensive support for Nepal attestation in Delhi NCR, including birth certificate attestation, marriage certificate attestation, degree certificate attestation, and commercial document legalization.\nOur professional services are designed for individuals looking for document attestation for Nepal in Delhi, certificate attestation near me, or expert help with MEA and Nepal embassy attestation services.
